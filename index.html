							<p>In the Fall 2018 semester, I fostered a middle school outreach program where I connected with middle schools in Leon county. The students were initially be able to ask questions they had about college and then move into the activity. For the activities, volunteers from the ICT program at Florida State went to various schools and taught interested students the basics of the binary alphabet. The interactive hangman activity in class tested the students on their knowledge of their name's and celebrities name's in binary code. The students showed mastery of the binary alphabet once the lesson plan was administered.</p>

							<p>In my advanced data analytics course, I had a semester long project where we had to use machine learning and statistical software like Weka, Orange, and Tableau to forecast whether a team will make it to the NBA playoffs based on the team's box score statistics over 5 seasons. The project introduced me to machine learning algorithms and how to properly analyze the results generated by the models my team and I created in Python. In Python, using the matplotlib and pandas libraries, I ran the decision tree, random forest, and support vector model algorithms on the NBA dataset provided by Kaggle.</p>

							<p>In my advanced database concepts course, we learned the basics of database construction through SQL using the SQL scripting language. I completed two major projects over the course of the semester, testing my ability to adequately constrct Entity Relationship Models(ERM) and use primary keys and foreign keys to link models. Overall, the course served as an excellent introduction into using SQL software. I learned to properly synthesize information to better suit a database, as well as sharpen my skills in writing code for real world applications.  </p>
